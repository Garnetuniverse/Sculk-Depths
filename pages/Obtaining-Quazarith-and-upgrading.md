* Quazarith can generate at y -192 or lower in a uniform distribution.
* It only generates exposed to air in veins from 1-3.
* When mined Quazarith drops Quazarith pieces (fortune is applied)

# Upgrading tools
1. First you will need to craft a Flumrock Cauldron

2. Next you will need to find Kryslum in a structure or at the bottom of the world and collect quite a bit (a bucket for each slot your tool or armor takes in the crafting table)

5. Finally right click your Netherite tools or armor on the cauldron
## Notes: 
* The amount of Quazarith and diamonds needed to upgrade it depends on the amount of slots the main material takes up in the crafting table
  * helmet cost = 5
  * chestplate cost = 8
  * leggings = 7
  * boots = 4
  * shovel = 1
  * pickaxe = 3
  * ...
* A Flumrock Cauldron can store a maximum of 12 diamonds, Quazarith Pieces and Kryslum Buckets
