## THIS MOD IS IN ALPHA, THINGS MAY CHANGE!

# Sculk Depths

# Important Notes
- This mods depends on Geckolib
- The 1.20 release no longer supports worlds created with older versions. The file "biome3.json" has been removed, causing biome3 to revert to plains. This change does not affect the 1.19 releases, where this biome will continue to be supported (for now).

3. this will drop Energy Essence which is used to craft an Energized Flint and Steel
4. Clear all the sculk veins from the middle of the reinforced deepslate in the center of the city.
